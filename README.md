#### 🚀 Reactorium (a blend of "React" (the UI library) and "laboratorium" (Latin for "laboratory, a place for experiments"), meaning "React laboratory") — a secret laboratory of React experiments, where each application holds a surprise crafted from lines of code and a touch of magic! ####

✨️ <ins>Each one is unique and covers different aspects of development — from visual experiments to practical tools:</ins><br>
🧊 Cube — 3D animation with size control.<br>
🧮 Calculator — both standard and finance modes, for any tasks.<br>
📝 Affairs — with data persistence in LocalStorage.<br>
🎲 Memory Game — a dynamic card-matching game.

#### 🔥 The project is powered by a solid stack of modern technologies that make development fast, efficient, and scalable. ####
